Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing
performed using *fMRIPrep* 24.1.1
(@fmriprep1; @fmriprep2; RRID:SCR_016216),
which is based on *Nipype* 1.8.6
(@nipype1; @nipype2; RRID:SCR_002502).


Anatomical data preprocessing

: A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input
BIDS dataset. The T1w image was corrected for intensity
non-uniformity (INU) with `N4BiasFieldCorrection` [@n4], distributed with ANTs 2.5.3
[@ants, RRID:SCR_004757], and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a *Nipype* implementation of
the `antsBrainExtraction.sh` workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs
as target template.
Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on
the brain-extracted T1w using `fast` [FSL (version unknown), RRID:SCR_002823, @fsl_fast].
Brain surfaces were reconstructed using `recon-all` [FreeSurfer 7.3.2,
RRID:SCR_001847, @fs_reconall], and the brain mask estimated
previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile
ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical
gray-matter of Mindboggle [RRID:SCR_002438, @mindboggle].
Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through
nonlinear registration with `antsRegistration` (ANTs 2.5.3),
using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template.
The following template was were selected for spatial normalization
and accessed with *TemplateFlow* [24.2.0, @templateflow]:
*ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c* [@mni152nlin2009casym, RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym].


Many internal operations of *fMRIPrep* use
*Nilearn* 0.10.4 [@nilearn, RRID:SCR_001362],
mostly within the functional processing workflow.
